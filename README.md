##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (preferably 3.7+)
- No external dependencies listed—expect to run directly with the standard library.

### Setup & Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/poornachandra-sarasAI/Melody_Manager.git
    cd Melody_Manager
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Launch the application:
    ```bash
    python User_Management.py
    ```
   This typically starts an interactive session leading into song management features.

4. Follow prompts to register or log in, then search, add, or manage songs.

##  Future Enhancements Ideas

- **Database Integration**: Migrate from flat file storage to relational or NoSQL databases for better scalability.
- **GUI Interface**: Implement a GUI using frameworks like `Tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `Kivy`.
- **Playlist Support**: Allow users to create, edit, and manage playlists.
- **Search Enhancements**: Incorporate fuzzy matching or meta-filtering (genres, duration, ratings).
- **User Roles**: Add admin vs user distinctions for more controlled access.
- **Export Capabilities**: Enable exporting song lists in formats like CSV or JSON.
